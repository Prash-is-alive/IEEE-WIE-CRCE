## Introduction

The IEEE WIE CRCE website is a web application developed using modern web technologies. It serves as a platform to showcase information about IEEE WIE at CRCE, including team members and events.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Hosting: Netlify
- Version Control: Git

## Project Structure

### Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Frontend source code
- `public/`: Public assets (e.g., images)
- `src/assets/`: Images used in the website
- `src/components/`: React components
- `public/`: Static assets (images, videos)
- `data/`: Data files (JSON)

### Key Files and Folders

- `src/components/`: React components
- `public/`: Static assets (images, videos)
- `data/`: Data files (JSON)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- npm

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/Prash-is-alive/IEEE-WIE-CRCE.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd IEEE-WIE-CRCE`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Frontend

### React Components

The frontend is built using React.js. Key components include:

- `Navbar.js`: Navigation bar component
- `Hero.js`: Main landing page component
- `MentorAbout.js`: Mentor section component
- `Team.js`: Team section component
- `Event.js`: Event section component
- `Contact.js`: Contact form component

### Styling

Styling is managed using CSS and possibly CSS-in-JS libraries. Stylesheets can be found in `src/components/` and are imported into respective components.

### Routing

React Router is used for client-side routing. Routes are defined in `src/App.js`.

## Deployment

### Hosting on Netlify

The website is hosted on Netlify. Deployment is managed automatically through Netlify's CI/CD pipeline, triggered by commits to the project's Git repository.

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) for automatic deployment upon code commits.

## Troubleshooting
